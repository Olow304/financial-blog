# financial blog
Learning MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) while building financial blog, mainly working with APIs.

Inspired by <strong>NextCapital</strong>

#### Don't use it yet.
I am still adding some changes.

### TODO:
 * [ ] Connect to MongoDB
 * [ ] Allow user to signup/in or third-party authentication
 * [ ] Set up redux - (before its too late, lol)
 * [ ] Fetch data (financial articls) from APIs
 * [ ] Display data
 * [ ] Allow user to save stock data (based on their search)
 * [ ] Allow user to post a financial advisor (creating post, reply, like, etc)
 * [ ] And more...
